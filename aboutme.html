            <p> I am a second-year college student from Drexel University majoring in User Experience & Interaction Design (UXID). I was part of Drexel's First Year Exploratory Studies program during my freshman year to diversify and explore different fields of studies, which led me to become a peer mentor to future freshmen during my second year in college. </p>
            <p> My professional goals are to gain exposure in UXID through collaboration in projects, which will help me develop leadership skills and gain more experience in it. I also want to broaden my skill set so that I can have multiple options for my future. </p>
            <p> Aside from being in school, I enjoy participating in events that can help with my growth and to experience new things, which I will showcase below. </p>
