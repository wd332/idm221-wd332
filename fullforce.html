        <p> Tackled an issue regarding college commuters and their disassociation with the college campus and other difficulties that come along with being a commuter. By utilizing the design process to generate solutions through physical and digital forms, an app was formed to help commuters connect, as well as to events customized to their available schedules and a locker where commuters can store their belongings. A lounge was also dedicated to commuters for relaxation, sleep, studying, and other necessities. </p>
